        <p>
        The Philippines is a destination that is easy to visit multiple times due to its more than 7,000 islands. The most difficult decision you make as a traveler, is figuring out which places to visit first. The Philippines is divided into the three main island groups of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, representing different regions in the country.
        The scenery in each region of the Philippines ranges from mountainous and tropical to metropolitan. You can enjoy a day of walking the historical colonial streets of the capital city of Manila or catch a rare glimpse of tiny tarsier monkeys at a private sanctuary on the island of Bohol. The steep, plush mountains provide unforgettable hiking experiences.</p>

       <p>Since you are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, it's not surprising the Philippines has some of the best beaches in Asia, and the scuba diving opportunities are outstanding.</p>

        <p>Plan your travels around this tropical island nation with our list of the best places to visit in the Philippines.</p>

        <div id="boracay">
        </div>
        <fieldset class="box">
        <p>There is a reason that Boracay Island is considered the beach capital of the Philippines because there are more than 12 beaches. This tiny island in the west Visayas region is ideal for beach-goers who are after simple relaxation in the sun or water activities. <strong>White Beach</strong>, on the west side of the island, is one of the
        best beaches in the Philippines.</p>
        <p><strong>Puka Shell Beach</strong> is on the tip of the island and is a favorite spot for shell collectors. <strong>Cagban Beach </strong> is a quiet spot with nearby caves that are rumored to still contain treasure chests. <strong>Diniwid Beach </strong>is a tiny beach at the north end of White Beach that has the best view of the island from a platform rock located there.

          This island is known for its many resorts, so finding a place to stay is easy. For a panoramic view of the island, take a day trip to Mount Luho, its highest point.</p>

          <p>The island of Bohol in the Philippines' central Visayas region runs at a slower pace, and it's a destination that showcases the country's natural beauty. One of the most unique natural wonders on the island is the <strong>Chocolate Hills</strong> in <strong>Carmen</strong>. This <strong>UNESCO</strong>-protected site is a collection of 1,200 geological formations that turn brown in the dry season, resembling a landscape of chocolate candy kisses.</p>
          <p>Bohol is home to a family-owned sanctuary for the tiny <strong>tarsier </strong>primate, known for its large engaging eyes. For a small fee, you can take an intimate walk through the grounds, and stand inches away from the small nocturnal mammal.</p>
          <p>The top draw of Bohol is the beach. Panglao Island features some of the best beaches in Bohol: <strong>Alona Beach</strong> and <strong>Danao Beach</strong>, which have fantastic diving; <strong>Dao Beach</strong> and <strong>Bingag Beach</strong>, which are popular resort areas; Bolod Beach, which has a large stretch of shoreline; and <strong>Doljo Beach</strong>, which is fairly remote but fantastic for finding seashells.</p>

        <fieldset class="box">
          <p>The rice terraces of Banaue are one of the most striking things to see in the Philippines. The emerald-green terraces are an agricultural wonder in this area. Some of the terraces are estimated to have been hand-carved into the mountainside more than 2,000 years ago.
          </p>
          <p>The <strong>Batad Rice Terraces</strong> and the <strong>Bangaan Rice Terraces</strong> are protected <strong>UNESCO World Heritage sites</strong>.</p>

          <p>
            Your most impressive view of the terraces is at sunrise, when clouds and fog lift off the mountain to reveal the intricate landscape of the terraces. You can base yourself in the town of Banaue and hike or drive to the Batad rice terraces, or arrange a stay in a native hut of the Ifugao people for a more authentic experience.
